# Frequently Questions and Answers

**Do I need to install and run the base (or any other) miner code?**\
\
No. You don't need to install or run any code. All you need to do is register your cold key in the Dojo subnet, create a hotkey, import it into your wallet (which is located in the browser extension), and connect to the Dojo platform. After that, you can perform tasks on the Dojo platform itself from your browser without embedding any code.
